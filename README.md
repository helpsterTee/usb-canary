USB Canary is a Linux and OSX tool that uses psutil to monitor USB devices
either around the clock, or just while your computer is locked. It can
be configured to send you an SMS via the Twilio API, or notify a Slack
channel with it's inbuilt Slack bot.

## Getting Started

There are a couple of 3rd party libraries to get USB Canary running - so
Linux and OSX users should read the prerequisites for their distribution.

### Prerequisites

- [slackclient](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient) - A
basic client for Slack.com, which can optionally connect to the Slack
Real Time Messaging (RTM) API.
- [twilio](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python) - A Python module
for communicating with the Twilio API and generating TwiML.
- [pushover](https://github.com/Thibauth/python-pushover) - Comprehensive bindings and command line utility for the Pushover notification service
- [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil) - Cross-platform lib
for process and system monitoring in Python.
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - GNU Compiler Collection
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Integrated development
environment for macOS
- [Quartz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc-framework-Quartz) -
Wrappers for the Quartz frameworks on macOS.

#### Installing Prerequisites on *Nix

Ubuntu and Debian users will need to make sure they have installed a C
compiler such as `gcc` as well as the `python-dev` package.

```
sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev python-pip
pip install psutil
```
Major Linux distros also provide binary distributions of psutil. However
this is not recommended as *Nix generall ship older versions.
```
sudo apt-get install python-psutil
```

You will also need to install the pip
[`apt` library](https://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/library/index.html)
through `apt` this can be done as follows:

```
sudo apt install python-apt
```

This library provides access to almost every functionality supported by
the underlying apt-pkg and apt-inst libraries. In Debian Jessie it may
come with the install but just double check to make sure it's there.

#### Installing Prerequisites on OSX

OSX users will need to install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/?name=Xcode) first then:
```
pip install psutil==5.3.1
```

OSX users will also need to manually install the [Quartz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc-framework-Quartz)
Python library as follows:
```
pip install pyobjc-framework-Quartz
```

Once distribution specific instractions have been followed the following
packages can all be installed via `pip`, in some cases you may need to
use `pip` with `sudo`. You can install the packages as follows:

```
pip install slackclient==1.0.9
pip install twilio==5.7.0
pip install python-pushover==0.3
pip install psutil==5.3.1
pip install sander-daemon==1.0.0
```

### Installing

Before running USB Canary, you will need to configure your `settings.json`
file, which should be located in the root directory. If it is not found
here, you will encounter an `IOError`.

An example `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "slack": {
      "api_key": "xoxb-111111111111-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx",
      "channel_name": "usb_canary",
      "botname": "USB Canary"
    },
    "twilio": {
      "auth_token": "l7cy56u3Nys72vPNRS8TAbaW3X1Ap4ma",
      "account_sid": "wP32p6qFNzJ25FD1IKM0YtX629eoHbrMiV",
      "twilio_number": "+61491570156",
      "mobile_number": "+61491570157"
    },
    "pushover": {
      "priority": 1,
      "user_key": "youruserkeygoeshere",
      "api_token": "yourapitokengoeshere"
    },
    "general": {
      "paranoid": true,
      "screensaver": "xscreensaver",
      "slack": false,
      "twilio": true,
      "pushover": false,
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `paranoid`, `slack` and `twilio` are boolean values and
should be set to `true` or `false`. If the file is formatted incorrectly
and it cannot be parsed, you will get a `ValueError`, you can use
[JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) if you find yourself having issues with
this.

# Linux

USB Canary, can 'detect' if you are running
`XScreenSaver` or `gnome-screensaver` on your computer, this is done by
just checking which packages are installed via the `apt` library, if
both of them are installed though, it will leave you to determine which
one you are using - if you have an unsupported screensaver, don't fret,
you can still run it in paranoid mode.

Paranoid mode is also suitable for people who want to monitor if their
servers have had USB's plugged into them,
although I haven't tested them on Linode, Amazon Web Services, or
Digital Ocean it is suitable for those with
physical servers that may need this sort of monitoring.

To start the application:
```shell
# Linux users
./usb_canary.py start | stop | restart
```

```shell
# OSX users
sudo ./usb_canary.py start | stop | restart

```

## Deployment

The following will outline the basic steps to deploying USB Canary to
Slack and Twilio.

### Twilio

To use the Twilio integration you will need to get an:
- [Auth Token](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-how-to-change-them)
- [Account SID](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136607-What-is-an-Application-SID-)
- Twilio Mobile Number with SMS support

### Slack

To use the Slack integration you will need to [setup a bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)

### Pushover

To use Pushover API for sending push messages to your devices, you need to create an [account and application](https://pushover.net/faq#overview-what)
